First section is the **Recent Activities & Monitoring**, which gives you a snapshot of what´s going on with the SAP Integration Suite tenant. It lists the artifacts that were worked upon and also the monitoring status of the deployed artifacts. You can navigate to them directly from here.

Now if you look at the different navigation sections on the left, after **Home**, you will see **Discover**, which is a repository of all standard pre-built content (integrations, APIs and type systems) shipped by SAP. Based on your specific integration need, you can explore, search and copy them to your **Design** workspace to kick-start your integration development.
